      <description>Project description Climate change, migration, and environmental degradation are interrelated in a complex coupled human and natural system. While people have historically abandoned places with harsh conditions, the scale of these flows is expected to increase dramatically as a result of climate change. Environmental migrants are individuals forced to migrate, internally or across borders, from their home region due to sudden or long-term changes to their local environment compromising their well-being or livelihoods.</description>
