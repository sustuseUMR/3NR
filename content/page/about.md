# Project description
Climate change, migration, and environmental degradation are interrelated in a complex coupled human and natural system. While people have historically abandoned places with harsh conditions, the scale of these flows is expected to increase dramatically as a result of climate change. Environmental migrants are individuals forced to migrate, internally or across borders, from their home region due to sudden or long-term changes to their local environment compromising their well-being or livelihoods.
 
The Mekong Delta in Vietnam is especially prone to both sudden and slow-onset environmental changes and disasters. It is inhabited by 18 million people, nearly a quarter of the country’s population, which live mostly in the low-lying floodplains that are 0.5 to 3 meters above sea level. The region is increasingly affected by effective sea-level rise (ESLR) that causes for example coastal erosion and flooding. Farmers depend on regular floods for irrigation of their fields. With rising water levels, floods become more frequent and unpredictable in their severity, which causes farmers problems sustaining their livelihoods. Researchers often describe Vietnam as one of the most exposed countries in the world to environmental changes.

We believe that doing field research in the Mekong Delta region offers valuable insights into a future of increasing uncertainty for one’s livelihoods due to various climatic changes. We are interested in how people make sense of changes in their environments, how they perceive risks and whether it affects their decision making. We use extensive survey experiments and modelling to study how the prospect of displacement, either individually or planned resettlements of entire communities, changes cooperation, social cohesion and resource use within communities. Furthermore, we are interested in how people seek and process information about the environment. What kind of information do they believe to be relevant or irrelevant? Do they want to avoid certain information and share other information within their social networks? The gained insights will help to get a better understanding of what factors influence the way people cope with the increasing uncertainty in their life’s due to environmental changes.

The results of this project will be published in a multiple peer-reviewed journal articles. If you are interested in additional information, feel free to contact one of us via email (see homepage).
